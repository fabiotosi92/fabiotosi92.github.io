Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (DISI) at the University of Bologna. My research interests are in computer vision and machine learning, with a particular focus on 3D reconstruction from images.

In 2021, I received my PhD degree from the University of Bologna under the supervision of Professor Stefano Mattoccia. Previously, I received a Master's and Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering in 2017 and 2014, respectively.
